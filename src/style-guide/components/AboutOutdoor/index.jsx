          SO Why choose Outdoor and Lifestyle Photography ?

          I mean SHEESH ! How should I even go on about expressing this ! In my
          opinion, there is no better way to showcase genuine moments than by
          documenting the complexities of daily life. It is a narrative that
          goes beyond posed portraits to capture the heartbeat of real-life
          moments. From a rider taking off their helmet to the subtle act of
          placing keys on the engine, these seemingly mundane actions become
          extraordinary when viewed through the lens of a camera. It's always
          the small details that make the narrative rich and meaningful. Whether
          it's the joy of a successful ride,
          <div className={styles.joyimg}></div>
          the capture of all the little details around you,
          <div className={styles.captureimg}></div> or the quiet satisfaction of
          a moment alone with the bike,
          <div className={styles.momentimg}></div> every frame tells a unique
          and heartfelt story .<div className={styles.uniqueimg}></div>
          <br />
          In my view, Being able to shape light, colour grade pictures and add
          ambience in Post is far more thrilling and breathtaking than pictures
          taken inside closed Studio rooms with artificial lights. One of the
          reasons as to why there is a trend and rise in Travel and Landscape
          Photography is because it enables the common individual to be able to
          go out and shoot without the use of Studio gear like strobe lights,
          backdrops, reflectors etc. knowing that they are not burdened by these
          equipments to get the "BUCKET SHOT". They can Experience the view for
          themselves and capture similiar results to what they had seen of the
          place. And if one knows their way in Photoshop/Lightroom about the
          various post
          <br />
          processing techniques they can achieve a better , authentic , natural
          and cinematic look without having to carry any of above accessories.
          And by blending into the background, they become storytellers who
          understand the nuances of lifestyle, ensuring that each photograph
          reflects not just an image but a personal journey.

          Afterall, It is all about memories we make and leave behind on this
          earth , impressions we make on the people we have met, freezing
          certain milestones and achievements and being able to back at old
          photographs as a source of joy and reflection,
          <div className={styles.oldimg}></div> is what makes Visual Media such
          as Photography an indispensable form of art <b>.</b>
